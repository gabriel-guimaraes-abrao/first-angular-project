  <p class="content">
    I started as a developer after being approved in one of the best IT companies in the world. After working in real
    projects
    and receiving good feedback, I decided to <span class="prm">specialize in Front-End development</span>, so dived
    into a deep study of the Angular
    Framework,
    expanding my skills to build a broad spectrum of web
    applications and websites.

  <p class="content"> I've build some <span class="prm">detailed demonstrations</span> to show you how I like things to
    be done. Come
    check them <span class="prm">in their section!</span></p>
